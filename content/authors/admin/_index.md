I am a psychological scientist at the University of Oxford's [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), where I study cognition and well-being in the context of online and digital media. Most recently, I have focused on the roles that digital technologies---particularly video games---play in people's lives. To study these topics, I apply statistical methods to large-scale datasets and conduct controlled experiments. I am also interested in meta-scientific work aimed at improving the transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor of psychological science more broadly.
